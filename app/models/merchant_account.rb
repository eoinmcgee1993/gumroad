  # For Stripe Connect (direct-charge) accounts: a cached snapshot of the account's Stripe
  # capabilities. Charges for these sellers are created on their account, not Gumroad's platform
  # account, and Stripe rejects a PaymentIntent whose payment_method_types lists a method the
  # account hasn't activated — so checkout must only offer what the account actually supports.
  # The FULL capabilities hash is stored (not just the methods consulted today) so future payment
  # method launches read from existing snapshots without a re-fetch sweep. Shape:
  # { "capabilities" => { "cashapp_payments" => "active", ... }, "refreshed_at" => <iso8601> }.
  # Refreshed by RefreshMerchantAccountPaymentMethodAvailabilityWorker (Stripe account.updated /
  # capability.updated webhooks, plus a lazy checkout-time backfill). A missing snapshot means
  # "not yet fetched" and checkout fails safe. Read via
  # StripeConnectPaymentMethodAvailabilityService, which owns the method-type → capability mapping.
